## Getting started

You can either
1. Clone the jazz repository, and run the app within the monorepo.
2. Or create a new Jazz project using this example as a template.


### Using the example as a template

Create a new Jazz project, and use this example as a template.
```bash
npx create-jazz-app@latest clerk-app --example clerk
```

Go to the new project directory.
```bash
cd clerk-app
```

Rename .env.example to .env
```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

Update `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with your [Publishable Key](https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#clerk-publishable-and-secret-keys) from Clerk.

Run the dev server.
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Using the monorepo
